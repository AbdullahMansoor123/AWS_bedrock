# End-to-End Generative AI Solution Using AWS Bedrock & Lambda

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to implement a Generative AI Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application on the cloud using AWS services. By leveraging AWS Bedrock for access to pre-trained models and AWS Lambda for serverless deployment, the application can be accessed anywhere via API calls. This solution is designed for scalability, security, and ease of use, making it an ideal choice for deploying AI-driven solutions on the cloud.

## Key Features

üåê AWS Bedrock Integration for access to customizable, pre-trained models.
‚ö° Serverless Deployment with AWS Lambda, ensuring event-driven execution and API integration.
üõ°Ô∏è Secure & Scalable Data Storage using AWS S3.
üéõÔ∏è Interactive Interface built with Streamlit for real-time data visualization and user interaction.
üìà Performance Monitoring & Cost Optimization for continuous improvement.
üåç Horizontal Scaling & Multi-Region Deployment for global reach.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Create a New Project in VS Code:**
   - Set up your development environment in VS Code.
2. **Initialize Git Repository:**
   - Create a Git repository and a `.gitignore` file to manage version control.
3. **Set Up Requirements:**
   - Create a `requirements.txt` file and list the necessary Python packages.
4. **Install Packages:**
   - Set up a Python environment and install the packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
5. **AWS Account Setup:**
   - Create an AWS account and obtain IAM user credentials.
6. **Save IAM Credentials:**
   - Store the IAM credentials securely in a `.env` file.
7. **Select AWS Bedrock Model:**
   - Choose the appropriate model API format from AWS Bedrock.[LINK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-meta.html)
8. **Create Prompt and Body:**
   - Develop a prompt and body using the selected AWS model API format.
9. **Write Core Functions:**
   - Implement functions to:
     - Access AWS Bedrock services using AWS credentials and API format.
     - Save data to AWS S3 (Optional: if you want to save result).
     - Create Lambda_handler function that takes data from event and pass it to the other function to get the require results.
10. **Package Boto3 as Lambda Layer:**
    - Package the Boto3 library in a zip file to use as an AWS Lambda layer.
11. **Set Up AWS Lambda:**
    - Configure AWS Lambda and add the Boto3 layer.
12. **Deploy Functions:**
    - Add your functions to AWS Lambda and deploy the Lambda function.
13. **Test Lambda Function:**
    - Test the deployed Lambda function to ensure it's working as expected.
14. **Set Up AWS API Gateway:**
    - Configure AWS API Gateway to expose your Lambda function as a RESTful API.
15. **Get API Endpoint:**
    - Retrieve the API endpoint from AWS API Gateway.
16. **Test API Using Postman:**
    - Use Postman to test the API by providing the required api from aws gateway and a payload.

Now, you can call the API from anywhere by providing the required payload.
